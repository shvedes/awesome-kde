# Essential Packages For Complete KDE Plasma Experience

![plasma](https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/6/6.2.0/fullscreen_with_apps.png)

This list highlights KDE and KDE-adjacent applications likely to enhance your KDE Plasma experience. All package names are specific to Arch-based distributions, but links to each application‚Äôs homepage provide further details.

#### But, why?

Switching to KDE from GNOME, XFCE, or other environments? If you‚Äôve fallen in love with KDE Plasma and want applications that seamlessly integrate with it, this list is for you. Instead of sifting through the vast and sometimes confusing repository at [apps.kde.org](https://apps.kde.org), this guide filters out the noise and showcases must-have apps.

**Note**: This guide doesn‚Äôt cover themes or cursors. For that, visit [this repository](https://github.com/francoism90/awesome-kde).

#### To Do

- [ ] Readability
- [ ] More small but important details
- [ ] Installation script for different distributions

## ‚ú® Components that enhance KDE functionality

If you use for example [KDE Neon](https://neon.kde.org), [Fedora KDE Spin](https://fedoraproject.org/spins/kde), [Kubuntu](https://kubuntu.org) and other systems where everything is ready out of the box, you may not need this section.

- [`svgpart`](https://apps.kde.org/svgpart) - allows [Ark](https://apps.kde.org/ark), [Kate](https://apps.kde.org/kate), [KDevelop](https://apps.kde.org/kdevelop), [Konqueror](https://apps.kde.org/konqueror) and [Krusader](https://apps.kde.org/krusader) to render `.svg` content without opening third-party applications
- [`markdownpart`](https://apps.kde.org/markdownpart) - allows [Ark](https://apps.kde.org/ark), [Kate](https://apps.kde.org/kate), [KDevelop](https://apps.kde.org/kdevelop), [Konqueror](https://apps.kde.org/konqueror) and [Krusader](https://apps.kde.org/krusader) to render markdown content without opening third-party applications
	- **How to enable in Kate**: *Settings > Plugins > Document Preview*
- `baloo-widgets` - provides extra metadata in [Dolphin‚Äôs](https://apps.kde.org/dolphin) Information Panel (requires Baloo file indexing)
- `dolphin-plugins` - adds [Git](https://git-scm.com), [Bazaar](https://www.gnu.org/software/bazaar), [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org), and ISO mounting support to [Dolphin](https://apps.kde.org/dolphin)
- `kde-inotify-survey` - a diagnostic tool to check the availability and limits of inotify, a Linux kernel feature for monitoring filesystem events. [Explanation](https://github.com/KDE/kde-inotify-survey)
- `kdenetwork-filesharing` - provide easily sharing files and directories over the network
- `kio-extras`, `kio-fuse`, `kio-gdrive,` `kio-admin` - provide seamless access to remote filesystems, cloud storage (e.g., Google Drive), network protocols, and administrative file management in KDE applications and beyond
- `kwalletmanager` - System Settings module for [kwallet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KWallet)
- `xwaylandvideobridge` -  exposes [Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org) screen into [X11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System) window. Useful for apps that doesn't support [Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org) / [Pipewire](https://pipewire.org) screen sharing
- `iio-sensor-proxy` - automatic screen rotation. Useful for wearable devices
- `libappindicator-gtk3` - Tray icon for [GTK3](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk3) apps
- `maliit-keyboard` - on-screen keyboard
- `power-profiles-daemon` - enables the power profile functionality in Plasma.  **Please** read the note below
- `xdg-desktop-portal-gtk`, `xsettingsd` - sync [GTK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTK) font / theme settings with Plasma
- `orca` - screen reader
- `systemd-coredumpd` - crash handler

> [!warning] For `power-profiles-daemon` users
> The `power-profiles-daemon` works with the CPPC driver, which adjusts CPU frequencies differently than `acpi-cpufreq`. If your processor does not support CPPC (e.g. zen1 or some zen2 CPUs) you can install `tuned` and `tuned-ppd` as replacements for `power-profiles-daemon`. 
> Remember to enable the systemd service for both packages immediately after installation. Reboot is not needed
> ```bash
> sudo pacman -S tuned tuned-ppd
> sudo systemctl enable --now tuned tuned-ppd
> ```


### üñºÔ∏è Thumbnailing plugins

## üõë Apps you might want to avoid

Apps that you might want to install, but are pointless because Plasma already has this functionality right out of the box.

- [`kcolorchooser`](https://apps.kde.org/kcolorchooser) - color picker. 
    - **Reason**: Plasma has a built-in widget that does the same thing
    - **How To**: *Right Click on the taskbar > Add or Manage Widgets > Color Picker >  \*drag into the taskbar\* right click on the widget (applet) > Open Color Dialog*
- [`kmag`](https://apps.kde.org/kmag) - screen magnifier. 
    - **Reason**: Plasma has a built-in desktop effect that does the same thing in a more convenient way
    - **How To**: *System Settings > Window Management > Desktop Effects > Zoom Effect*
